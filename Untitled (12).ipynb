    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "ans-\n",
    "A database is a collection of data that is organized in a way that enables efficient retrieval, manipulation, and storage of data. Databases are commonly used to store data for various applications, such as websites, business systems, and scientific research.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL databases are two different types of databases that differ in their structure, data model, and how they store and retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables with rows and columns. SQL databases are based on the relational model and use SQL as the standard language for querying and managing data. SQL databases are typically used for structured data, where the data is organized in a fixed schema, and the relationships between data are well-defined. SQL databases are popular for their ability to provide consistency, reliability, and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that store data in flexible and dynamic schemas. NoSQL databases are designed for unstructured or semi-structured data, where the data is not organized in a predefined schema or structure. NoSQL databases are optimized for high performance, scalability, and availability, making them ideal for handling large volumes of data in distributed environments. NoSQL databases offer a range of data models, such as document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational and use tables with fixed schemas, while NoSQL databases are non-relational and use flexible schemas.\n",
    "SQL databases use SQL as the standard language for querying and managing data, while NoSQL databases offer different query languages depending on the data model.\n",
    "SQL databases are ideal for structured data with well-defined relationships, while NoSQL databases are designed for unstructured or semi-structured data and are optimized for scalability and performance.\n",
    "Both SQL and NoSQL databases have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of database depends on the specific requirements of the application.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's a brief explanation of some commonly used DDL statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create a new database object, such as a table, view, or index. For example, the following SQL statement creates a new table called \"customers\" with columns for customer name, address, and phone number:\n",

    "    address VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    phone_number VARCHAR(20)\n",
    ");\n",
    "DROP: The DROP statement is used to remove an existing database object, such as a table or view. For example, the following SQL statement drops the \"customers\" table created in the previous example:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify an existing database object, such as adding or removing columns from a table. For example, the following SQL statement adds a new column called \"email\" to the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers\n",
    "ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table while leaving the table structure intact. For example, the following SQL statement removes all data from the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE customers;\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are brief explanations and examples of three commonly used DML statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT: The INSERT statement is used to insert new data into a table. For example, the following SQL statement inserts a new row into a \"customers\" table with values for customer name, address, and phone number:\n",

    "Copy code\n",
    "INSERT INTO customers (customer_name, address, phone_number)\n",
    "VALUES ('John Smith', '123 Main St', '555-1234');\n",
    "UPDATE: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table. For example, the following SQL statement updates the phone number for the customer with a customer_id of 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "sql\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "UPDATE customers\n",
    "SET phone_number = '555-5678'\n",

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "ans-\n",
    "In a relational database, a primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each row in the table is uniquely identified and can be referenced by other tables. A primary key can be composed of one or more columns in a table, but the combination of these columns must be unique for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a \"customers\" table with columns for \"customer_id\", \"customer_name\", and \"customer_email\". In this case, the \"customer_id\" column could be used as the primary key since it uniquely identifies each customer record in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a link between two tables in a relational database, allowing data to be shared and referenced across tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a \"orders\" table that contains columns for \"order_id\", \"customer_id\", and \"order_date\". In this case, the \"customer_id\" column in the \"orders\" table could be defined as a foreign key that references the \"customer_id\" primary key in the \"customers\" table. This would allow data from the \"customers\" table to be linked to the \"orders\" table and enable queries that join data from both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, primary keys are used to uniquely identify each record in a table, while foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables in a relational database.
